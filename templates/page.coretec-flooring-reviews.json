However, you might have a concern about how long it takes to do the cleaning process. All it takes is simple mopping, vacuuming (without rotating beater bars), and sweeping every week to maintain cleanliness. For a deeper clean, use dish soap with warm water to pick up stains. COREtec also has a branded pH-neutral cleaner product called Encore Cleaner. It helps clean up dirt, grease, and scuffs with no rinsing required. You'll only need an hour to clean your floor, depending on how much of it is in your home. <\/p><p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.floorcity.com\/collections\/coretec\" title=\"https:\/\/www.floorcity.com\/collections\/coretec\">Shop COREtec Flooring<\/a><\/p>"}},"561cc7d9-4bc6-4b90-8653-39b60e899c71":{"type":"question","settings":{"title":"If my COREtec floor gets wet, what do I do?","answer_video":"","answer":"<p>While COREtec assures their floors are waterproof, you may have to take action if you have a flood in your home.

Wood is one of the more popular choices for the reason no one can usually tell the difference from the real deal. COREtec's most recent wood floors are extra durable thanks to specific layers used.<br\/><br\/>The top layer is a genuine wood veneer so it looks like real wood. Only experts can tell it's not to the naked eye. On that first layer is a UV acrylic finish to help protect the surface from stains. This type of finish also helps with easier stain clean-up.<br\/><br\/>The middle layer is a mineral core that makes COREtec floors waterproof. Thanks to extra-rigid support, it prevents the material from warping or swelling when exposed to moisture. COREtec patented this mineral core, making the design unique from anything else out there.<br\/><br\/>The bottom layer is the cork underlayment. Beyond providing extra comfort to walk on, the cork material helps protect against certain elements like mold and mildew when floods occur. Also, it creates perfect sound control for noisy environments, whether at home or in a business.<br\/><br\/>Keep in mind the design layer comes in a variety of textures. You can get these with detailed embossing and beveling.<br\/><br\/>The solid, waterproof polymer core layer is also easy to install over your existing floor. This layer is even dent-resistant to withstand heavy items.<br\/><br\/>All COREtec stone floors are chip and crack-resistant, including integrated grout lines. These are made to look like real tile, yet softer, warmer, and quieter. <\/p>"}}},"block_order":["template--15915207884857__dbf03c85-0294-4dc2-b54f-db391b78ca4c-question-1","template--15915207884857__dbf03c85-0294-4dc2-b54f-db391b78ca4c-question-2","template--15915207884857__dbf03c85-0294-4dc2-b54f-db391b78ca4c-question-3","ff4c1db9-e721-4c05-ac8a-f2bdbedd9c24","e058103a-cbbb-45d5-acae-84e13d692aa4","02f66791-4b30-4f7a-8569-fd0f322a297e","37606909-576e-4157-a7dd-02452aabb7f6","e19fd5a1-12d2-4c33-812d-bfe78ae3d20b","561cc7d9-4bc6-4b90-8653-39b60e899c71","eabb39e8-24a0-48e3-afd9-b5a117c60d1b"],"custom_css":[".container--narrow {max-width: 1000px;}"],"settings":{"show_contact_info":false,"contact_info_heading":"Pre-Purchase Q&A","contact_info_text":"<p>If we still haven't answered your question, you can contact us below and we will get back to you as soon as possible.<\/p>","contact_1_icon":"bi-phone","contact_1_heading":"Customer support","contact_1_text":"<p>Enter your text here<\/p>","contact_2_icon":"bi-email","contact_2_heading":"Send a message","contact_2_text":"<p>Enter your text here<\/p>"}},"fbaef62d-c855-45d9-98c5-cb28df2f0888":{"type":"custom-html","custom_css":[".flex-container {display: flex;

All Luxury Vinyl Plank flooring is this way in comparison to real wood. If you have significant foot traffic at home or in your business, a wooden floor is sure to look worn after only a year. COREtec assures no scratching, marks, or scars. Expect these floors to hold up for years before repairs or replacements are needed.<br\/><br\/><strong>Pro: Affordable<\/strong><\/p><p>All COREtec floors are half the price of real wood, making it price-friendly when budgeting matters. Unlike other things that are of lesser quality when cheaper, COREtec doesn't lose any quality. It's thanks to cork and rubber base materials, eliminating any need for underlayment.<br\/><br\/><strong>Pro: Kid and Pet-Friendly<\/strong><\/p><p>Your little humans, dogs, cats, rabbits, ferrets and other common household pets are no-match for COREtec's ultra resilient wear layer. Unlike some floors that scratch from pet nails or or stain from animal urine; COREtec does not. It's also designed to withstand your kids plastic toys and constant abuse from dropping other items on the floor. COREtec is not industructible but is far more resistant to scratches and dents than most other flooring on the market. <br\/><br\/><strong>Pro: Easy Installation<\/strong><\/p><p>The time it takes to install a new floor is always a concern for homeowners and businesses. COREtec Plus and Pro floors are much easier to install than a real wood floor. Top vinyl plank brands like them offer a tongue and groove system that makes installing these planks simpler than ever. They click into place with ease.<br\/><br\/><strong>Pro: Perfect for Noisy Rooms<\/strong><\/p><p>Sound control is always a concern with new flooring, especially if holding parties at home.

Now hundreds of people can walk your vinyl plank floors at the same time without any ear-piercing noise.<br\/><br\/><strong>Pro: Comfortable<\/strong><\/p><p>How a floor feels while walking on it is just as important to consider.

Those who need a soft, quality floor find it works as an alternative to wood and even carpeting.<br\/><br\/><strong>Pro: You Can Find COREtec Floors Anywhere<\/strong><\/p><p>Buying a wood floor is already going to become a more protracted buying experience.

It's virtually never out of stock, plus available in numerous colors and other varieties. Finding good deals online is another major pro. Some online flooring stores offer better pricing on COREtec.<br\/><br\/><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><strong>CONS<\/strong><\/span><\/p><p><strong>Con: You'll Need to Replace Your Floor Eventually<\/strong><\/p><p>Expect a COREtec floor to last for a couple of decades with proper care. However, you can't sand and refinish them as you can wood. You'll have to replace those planks once you know it's completely worn. Nevertheless, they're easy to remove due to their initial installation process.<\/p><p><strong>Con: You Might Have to Level Your Floor First if Uneven<\/strong><\/p><p>Having an uneven floor can sometimes be an issue when using vinyl planks. As a result, it may require you to level your subfloor before you can use these floors. Your COREtec floor could depress when walking on it otherwise. Calculate the cost of leveling ahead of time by considering an investment in a self-leveling mix. <\/p>","button_text":"","button_link":"shopify:\/\/collections\/all"}},"c709401f-be36-416f-8742-899874b922b7":{"type":"rich-text","custom_css":[".rte {text-align: left;}"],"settings":{"text_width":"regular","title":"Residential Applications","content":"<p><strong>Bathrooms<\/strong><\/p><p>How you remodel a bathroom may be one of your biggest home project questions right now. Placing a COREtec Plus vinyl floor in there can become the most affordable remodel plan you ever make. Your bathroom is perhaps the most visited room in your house, which means the floor already in there is likely worn. If that floor happens to be real hardwood or other material, it may need replacing soon.<br\/><br\/>After years of foot traffic and a few floods, hardwood is not going to hold up. Lack of maintenance only makes it more of an inevitability you need a new floor.<br\/><br\/>Going with COREtec Plus in your bathroom is already going to save you exponential money compared to other options. Real wood is still very expensive, yet vinyl is still one of the most affordable floors in the marketplace. Upgrading your bathroom floor to COREtec vinyl planks is the smartest choice if you ever faced flooding in there before. The second layer is a patented mineral core COREtec designed to prevent any mold or mildew. A flood in your bathroom is bound to happen eventually. It could come from a toilet running over, a shower\/bathtub leak, or from a leaky sink\/faucet. A wooden floor is a goner in those scenarios, yet COREtec vinyl planks are saved. Simply remove the planks if sopping wet, let them dry, and they're ready to go back in place.<br\/><br\/>In the realm of foot comfort, COREtec is still top-tier. Considering you spend a lot of time in your bathroom, you want it to feel good underfoot. The company's cork underlayment makes it one of the most comfortable floors available today. How to clean your COREtec floor is also likely on your mind. A bathroom is going to have spills if you have a big family. Pet stains are another sure bet if your dog or cat plays in the bathroom. Their litter box may be in there as well. COREtec makes cleanup easy with simple sweeping and vacuuming, plus the company's unique cleaning solution.<br\/><br\/>These features of COREtec Plus are sure to help revitalize your bathroom soon. Thanks to an easy click-lock installation method, these planks can go in there within a short time without causing complaints about your bathroom being held up.<br\/><br\/><strong>Kitchens<\/strong><\/p><p>Learning how to install a kitchen floor might sound like a major housing remodeling project. Your kitchen floor could be worn out now after years of family and guests putting in hours of foot traffic. This doesn't include your kids and likely some pets.<br\/><br\/>Perhaps your worn kitchen floor was made of hardwood. If so, not putting in any maintenance time makes wood deteriorate fast. With all that traffic in your kitchen besides, your hardwood floor likely looks a little rough now. The same goes for other types of flooring that don't have durable qualities. Only vinyl continues to work as the most robust flooring while not costing a fortune. COREtec Plus vinyl flooring is a leader in this flooring category, especially for use in kitchens.<br\/><br\/>There isn't a more appropriate floor for a kitchen than COREtec. Durability and stain resistance are two good reasons. Vinyl is already known for being rugged to foot traffic. When adding in COREtec's acrylic finish surface, it also becomes impervious to stains. We all know a kitchen is going to have more stains than most rooms, other than a garage. No food stains will set in on these floors as long as you don't wait long to clean.<br\/><br\/>Using simple vacuuming, sweeping, and mopping once per week also keeps your floor looking new. It's the simplest type of maintenance when compared to the more lengthy work put into maintaining real hardwood. You can still get the look of real hardwood, though, particularly when using COREtec Plus. Most people can't tell the difference between real and faux wood here, making it ideal if you still want your kitchen looking rustic.<br\/><br\/>The waterproof nature of COREtec is also what makes them ideal for kitchens. Other than bathrooms, kitchens are more prone to water exposure. This might be from water spills (including from your pets' water bowls) to possibly a leak from a dishwasher, refrigerator, or sink. A mineral core layer helps prevent the planks from ever warping. Thanks to that same layer, it also prevents mold and mildew. And, what kind of comfort do you need while walking or standing on your kitchen floor? Someone in the family possibly works there for hours making meals. A cork underlayment provides a soft and warm feel that makes standing in place or walking feel like a cloud. Even more important is COREtec's innovation in vinyl plank sound control. Their cork underlayments are the material you need to muffle overly loud sounds in your kitchen. As you make meals, the sounds of mixers and other electric utensils could become a little ear-piercing when guests are there.<br\/><br\/>Now you can converse with your friends and family without noise being a problem. This also applies to large groups of people talking at once.<br\/><br\/>Time to take your new kitchen floor seriously and learn how to get a COREtec Plus vinyl plank floor installed. With click-lock features available on most of their floor brands, you can install your new kitchen floor with relative ease. If you have to remove a plank for replacement or due to water, you can do so just as easily.<br\/><br\/><strong>Laundry Rooms<\/strong>Most people have a laundry room, whether in a special place in the house, in the basement, or garage. What is the best flooring for a basement laundry room in particular? This is the most common location for laundry rooms, and it's going to require a certain type of robust floor to hold up long-term. Real hardwood is never the best choice for basements simply based on the idea these rooms sometimes flood. Wood is unsalvageable if it becomes excessively wet.<br\/><br\/>More people choose either linoleum or vinyl planks in basements. With vinyl planks being more durable and often made to withstand water, it's a smart choice. COREtec Plus vinyl floors are the leader in this category. Their specific attention to being waterproof makes them a go-to floor for a laundry room and many other rooms. Sooner or later, a flood may occur in your laundry room, no matter where it's located. A broken water pipe might occur, or your washing machine runs over. Chances for flooding there are as great as the kitchen or bathroom.<br\/><br\/>The most useful aspect of COREtec Plus is its waterproof qualities. The absorption of water is all based on the hand-formed mineral core in the second layer of each plank. These materials also help prevent mildew and mold, which is critical to avoid getting sick after a flood. Your laundry room may also be seen by guests on occasion. Thanks to the aesthetic beauty of COREtec floors, you can convince someone you used real hardwood. To the naked eye, most experts still can't tell the difference between COREtec's vinyl planks and the real deal.<br\/><br\/>While aesthetics and waterproofness are essential here, so is how comfortable it feels. Members of your household assigned to laundry duty will appreciate standing on these floors without it feeling like wood. A cork underlay helps provide real comfort so your feet never feel sore when standing in place.

What does that entail? The floor of the mudroom is a vital part of it since this room is where people remove their shoes, coats, or other outerwear before entering a main living area. Just imagine what those people are tracking in as they enter your mudroom. In wet climates, this is going to mean their shoes bringing in water, mud, oil, and who knows what else from the outside world.<br\/><br\/>This is why your floor in the mudroom needs some serious thought. Don't even think about using real hardwood since it would deteriorate in a year due to the excess moisture and foot traffic. Vinyl flooring is one of your best options, especially COREtec Plus vinyl planks. Through a product like theirs, you can get extra protection for residential customers.

If your dental practice is new, it might take a while for it to become profitable. Having to replace your floor within a year or two only adds a major expense you don’t need. COREtec’s brands stay maintained as long as you keep them clean every week. You may still want to get a higher mil wear layer for your practice, just in case those floors get busier over time. As your dental practice grows, it’s always worth thinking ahead on what your floor might have to endure down the road.<br\/><br\/>Beyond the durability factor, COREtec has your dentist’s office covered to take on any nasty spills or stains. You already know by now that stains are inevitable, including from patients and dental devices. On the comfort side, your dental team is going to appreciate COREtec’s comfortable cork underlay. Orthodontists and their assistants have to stand all day on your floor to work on patients. Why not give them a floor feeling comfortable for them rather than using real hardwood?<br\/><br\/>Not that you still can’t enjoy the look of natural materials thanks to COREtec’s wide variety of textures and colors. Your dental private practice can now thrive with a trendy look without having to spend a fortune or take on lengthy floor maintenance time.  <\/p>","button_text":"","button_link":"shopify:\/\/collections\/all"}},"38b6276e-43e6-4941-b283-78e9215e2e0b":{"type":"rich-text","custom_css":[".rte {text-align: left;}"],"settings":{"text_width":"regular","title":"Attached Cork Underlayment Backing","content":"<p>Genuine cork is used as the backing (they call this an attached underlayment). Cork was chosen because it resists mold and mildew, is sound deadening and is quicker to warm up. So unlike a tile floor for example, you have less of that cold floor feel when walking barefoot or in socks.<br\/><br\/>In addition, and this is important from a floor prep and installation perspective, the cork backing minimizes the telegraphing of subfloor imperfections. You’ve probably seen this at some point where you can see humps, bumps or floor seams subtly showing up through the floor. The attached cork underlayment saves time in floor prep and contributes to a solid, finished floor installation that will provide years of service.<br\/><br\/>Jim Atkinson, a professional house flipper in Boston, MA, said “We deal with a lot of old triple deckers here in South Boston, many have undergone multiple rehabs over the years - some not so great. Once we pull up the old carpet or vinyl sheet, we run into some crazy situations. I only use COREtec, not only because it's a great selling point on quality, but because it minimizes our floor rehab times. We take pride in professionally repairing and stabilizing all subflooring to code, but with COREtec we don’t have to worry about minor subfloor imperfections transfering up and showing through the flooring at install time. Our buyers love it. It looks great every time and we’ve never had a call back on it!”<\/p>","button_text":"","button_link":"shopify:\/\/collections\/all"}},"56af71d1-42bd-43d7-a194-452fd14a44ef":{"type":"rich-text","custom_css":[".rte {text-align: left;}"],"settings":{"text_width":"regular","title":"Durable Wear Layer Protects your Floor from Scratches","content":"<p>COREtec features a commercial grade, low gloss wear layer up to 20 mil thick. What’s a wear layer and why is it important? It's the top most layer of the floor. Think of the wear layer as your floor's armor protection; it's permanent, transparent, very durable and has an important job to do: protect your floor from all manner of scratches, scuffs, and stains. The wear layer helps to maintain the good looks of your floor and makes it very easy to clean. In addition it offers a degree of UV protection, but take note: prolonged, strong exposure to sunlight will damage any material.<br\/><br\/>A word of caution, it's recommended that heavy furniture have felt pads attached and use floor protectors for office chairs with caster wheels. The wear layer protects the floor, but any floor is susceptible to scratches, even tile and cement. Most people just sweep and use a dust mop to keep their floors looking great. Unlike a hardwood floor no wood cleaners, conditioners or polishing is needed.<br\/><br\/>Janet Holmes from Portland, Oregon manages a mid sized accounting firm, she said “COREtec flooring transformed our office and conference rooms into an upscale feel which was an important consideration for the type of clients we work with. The staff was blown away by the transformation. Our cleaning service just vacuums the floors to keep them looking great. We required something that stands up to floor traffic, is simple to clean, and looks fantastic. COREtec nailed it.”<\/p>","button_text":"","button_link":"shopify:\/\/collections\/all"}},"c5228743-5878-4bda-9ea4-039967fdac6e":{"type":"rich-text","custom_css":[".rte {text-align: left;}"],"settings":{"text_width":"regular","title":"100% Waterproof Flooring","content":"<p>We want to be clear on this point. For several reasons you want a waterproof, moisture and humidity proof floor. Why? For starters a lot of flooring products out there, with the exception of stone and tile, will warp, buckle, disintegrate or expand when water sits on them for a period of time.<br\/><br\/>Expansion has the worst effect on flooring because it pushes out and buckles far beyond where the original water spill occurred. When this happens replacing the floor is the only option. Understandably, if you've never experienced a major water spill in your kitchen or bathroom, it's hard to imagine this as a possibility. Consequently every year people are surprised to discover their dishwasher, refrigerator, bathtub or sink has sprung a leak and a large puddle of water has developed on and ruined their floor. At that point it's permanent, heartbreaking and requires a time consuming and expensive replacement.<br\/><br\/>Waterproof flooring is also required if you’re installing a floor covering below grade, for example: basements and homes that are situated on a hillside or valley where water runoff could become an issue. Basements are especially prone to occasional leaking and moisture intrusion, sometimes it is major and obvious, but often it goes unnoticed by the homeowner. We see a lot of this with new homeowners who remodel their basement in the summer only to discover water leakage over the winter and rainy season. COREtec is an ideal flooring solution for basement remodels because it’s 100% waterproof. It won't warp, expand or contract even when submerged in water.<br\/><br\/>Bill Gorrell of Chicago IL, shared this review with us “We woke up in the morning to discover a puddle of water covering most of our kitchen floor. Immediately we put towels down to soak up the water thinking more about where the leak came from rather than the flooring.<br\/>Then I started to notice the floor planks were bowing and buckling and starting to rise up. 'Oh no' is all I could say. My wife said, 'look it’s pushing up all the way on the other side of the floor'. We dried it as best we could hoping when the floor dried out it would somehow return to normal. Of course it didn't.<br\/>Turns out the water line to the refrigerator (icemaker\/water dispenser) was the culprit. Honestly, I never envisioned this as a possibility, but our insurance agent said it was a common occurrence.<br\/>From there it was a long odyssey of insurance, contractors, and installation hassels. The only real good thing that came out of it was we went with COREtec flooring. I always thought of vinyl flooring as having a hollow sound, but this flooring has a wonderful solid, quality feel. Also they look great and oh, by the way, they’re 100% waterproof. Kudos to COREtec!”<\/p>","button_text":"","button_link":"shopify:\/\/collections\/all"}},"61280e4b-8676-4d41-a7d5-cb850bb5b6dc":{"type":"image-with-text","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/coretecflooringmodern.jpg","image_position":"left","image_width":40,"title":"The “Core” of COREtec - Waterproof Polymer Core (WPC)","content":"<p>What makes COREtec Plus different? It starts with their innovative Waterproof Polymer Core (WPC). Think of each floor plank as several sandwiched layers.

Won't chip or break. No expansion or contraction due to humidity or temperature changes. Resists scratches, scuffs and stains. Easy to clean. 100% waterproof even if submerged in water.<br\/><br\/>Bob Sheppard of South Florida said “We have a lot of heat and humidity down here and combined with air conditioning, which constantly cools and dehumidifies, you have a recipe for disaster for a solid wood floor - this killed my mother in law's expensive solid hardwood flooring. Our installer recommended we look at COREtec because it's dimensionally stable no matter the temperature and its 100% waterproof. I was sceptical at first, but when I saw the samples I was really impressed with the looks and especially with the matching wood grain pattern - this was important to me because I wanted a natural looking floor. Fast forward a year and the floor is still perfect, it hasn't loosened or shifted and looks as great as it did when we got it.

Installation tools include: carbide-tipped blade, rubber mallet, spacers, measuring tape, tapping block, pull bar, and of course safety glasses.<br\/><br\/>Sam Gorden, a homeowner in Houston, TX shared his experience installing COREtec in the review “At first I was a little nervous about installing the flooring myself. I’m somewhat handy around the house, but have never done anything with flooring. I kept thinking I needed to hire a professional installer. But as I watched several YouTube videos, my thinking changed and I thought, 'hey I can really do this myself!'. And sure enough it was true. When the flooring arrived I opened several boxes and dry laid out the pattern I thought looked best. After some minor changes and final approval from my wife I started my first row. Just like the videos showed it was easy to install and after a few rows my confidence really shot up. The first transition strip was a bit tricky, but once I had the technique down the whole project went surprisingly quick. It took one day and my wife was freaking out at how great it looked. I was impressed with how quickly the job went. I have to say it looks really good! The floor feels solid all around and just like the brochure said it’s easy to clean. Only problem now is I have people asking me to do install new floors for them. I’ll take that as a compliment.
